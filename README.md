# AI-102-Process-Speech

A code repository for the Process and Translate Speech with Azure Cognitive Speech Services learning path. The content of this repository is related to the modules that form part of the learning paths and content for the Worldwide Learning AI-102 Azure AI Engineer track.

The repo contains folders, and code files where necessary, to support the speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation services that are part of the Speech SDK.  The instructions and supporting content for the labs are found on the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) platform and linked to the [AI Engineer role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?roles=ai-engineer).

The content and labs are in various stages of development and release so you may not see all of the content available at the same time this repo is made public.  Therefore, the folders and code files will not appear complete or functional, without the supporting content in place.  Please do not log issues or pull requests unless the supporting content is live on the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) site.
